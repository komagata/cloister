= I18n generators

This gem plugin generates a set of locale files for Rails 2.2 i18n feature.

* http://github.com/amatsuda/i18n_generators/tree/master


== FEATURES

This gem/plugin provides following three script/generate commands.

=== 1. Generate Locale Files for ActiveRecord/ActiveSupport/ActionPack

% ./script/generate i18n_locales ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

This will generate following locale files.

    config/initializers/i18n_config.rb
    config/locales/action_view_ja.yml
    config/locales/active_record_ja.yml
    config/locales/active_support_ja.yml

Basically, all the generated .yml files in config/locale directory are copied from en-US.yml files bundled inside Rails framework, and each attribute value is one-to-one localized/translated into the specified locale/language.
Also, the generated config file adds the generated .yml files to the I18n load_path, and sets the application default locale to the specified locale.

=== 2. Generate Models/Attributes Translation Yaml File For All Models

% ./script/generate i18n_models ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

This will generate following YAML file.

    config/locales/models_ja.yml

This file contains definitions of all the AR model names and attributes in your app/models directory, so that you don't have to write the YAML skeleton manually or by copy/paste.
In addition, the generator tries to translate each of them into the specified language.
The generator doesn't overwrite the existing value so that you can rerun the generator again and again just like Annotate Model plugin.

=== 3. Generate All

% ./script/generate i18n ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

Generates all the i18n_locales and i18n_models files at once.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby on Rails (>= 2.2)
* Ruby-GetText-Package ( http://rubyforge.org/projects/gettext/ )
* high speed Internet connection


== INSTALL:

* As a gem

% sudo gem install amatsuda-i18n_generators -s http://gems.github.com

* As a Rails plugin

% ./script/plugin install git://github.com/amatsuda/i18n_generators.git


== CAUTION

Current version of this plugin is very very very very roughly implemented just for experiment.
Every time you execute the generate command, the plugin connects to the Unicode CLDR website and scrapes the huge amount of its contents.
Please be careful not to harm your network environment and CLDR website by running this plugin too many times.
